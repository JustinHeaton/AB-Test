    "# Running an A/B Test on the Udacity Homepage\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of this experiment, Udacity courses currently have two options on the home page: \"start free trial\", and \"access course materials\". If the student clicks \"start free trial\", they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they cancel first. If the student clicks \"access course materials\", they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked \"start free trial\", they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course. If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free. At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead. This screenshot shows what the experiment looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis was that this might set clearer expectations for students upfront, thus reducing the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn't have enough time—without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course. If this hypothesis held true, Udacity could improve the overall student experience and improve coaches' capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unit of diversion is a cookie, although if the student enrolls in the free trial, they are tracked by user-id from that point forward. The same user-id cannot enroll in the free trial twice. For users that do not enroll, their user-id is not tracked in the experiment, even if they were signed in when they visited the course overview page."

    "**Metric Choice**\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following metrics would you choose to measure for this experiment and why? For each metric you choose, indicate whether you would use it as an invariant metric or an evaluation metric. The practical significance boundary for each metric, that is, the difference that would have to be observed before that was a meaningful change for the business, is given in parentheses. All practical significance boundaries are given as absolute changes.\n",
    "Any place \"unique cookies\" are mentioned, the uniqueness is determined by day. (That is, the same cookie visiting on different days would be counted twice.) User-ids are automatically unique since the site does not allow the same user-id to enroll twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Number of cookies: *That is, number of unique cookies to view the course overview page. (dmin=3000)* This is an appropriate choice as an invariant metric because cookies are counted before the users are exposed to the experiment, also it is the unit of diversion for the project and therefore an equal number of cookies would be expected in each group.\n",
    "* Number of user-ids: *That is, number of users who enroll in the free trial. (dmin=50)* This is not a good choice as an invariant metric because the user-ids are counted after the click occurs, and therefore will be effected by the test. User-ids is also not useful as an evaluation metric because, although it does tell us how many users converted, there is no way to normalize the number because the value has no denominator.\n",
    "* Number of clicks: *That is, number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button (which happens before the free trial screener is trigger). (dmin=240)* This is a good choice as an invariant metric because clicks happen before users are exposed to the experiment, Also, the users who click are the ones who see the change and for the experiment it is necessary to have an equal number in each group.\n",
    "* Click-through-probability: *The number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button divided by number of unique cookies to view the course overview page. (dmin=0.01)* This would be a valid choice as an invariant metric because it is counted before the user sees the experimental change, however, because it is a product of Number of Cookies and Number of Clicks, it is not necessary to include and will therefore be left out.\n",
    "* Gross conversion: *That is, number of user-ids to complete checkout and enroll in the free trial divided by number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button. (dmin= 0.01)* This is a good evaluation metric because it will allow us to see if the experiment had an effect on the number of users enrolling after they click.\n",
    "* Retention: *That is, number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by number of user-ids to complete checkout. (dmin=0.01)* Retention actually is a relevant metric for evaluation because it tells us exactly how many users remained enrolled after the trial period, however, it will be determined later in this report that using retention as an evaluation metric would cause the experiment to take too long, so it will not be included.\n",
    "* Net conversion: *That is, number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by the number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button. (dmin= 0.0075)* This is a good evaluation metric because the hypothesis is based on a change in this metric. Net conversion will allow us to see if the experiment had an effect on the number of uses who click and become paying customers after the free trial ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also decide now what results you will be looking for in order to launch the experiment. Would a change in any one of your evaluation metrics be sufficient? Would you want to see multiple metrics all move or not move at the same time in order to launch? This decision will inform your choices while designing the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Launch Criteria**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the goal of the is to decrease the number of frustrated students dropping out during the free trial, without creating a drop in the number of paying students, in order to recommend a launch after the experiment we would have to see a satistically and practically significant decrease in gross conversion, while at least maintaining a constant level of Net Conversions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these criteria must be met to warrant a recommendation to launch the change after the test:\n",
    "* A practically and statistically significant decrease in Gross Conversion.\n",
    "* No drop in Net Conversion.\n",
